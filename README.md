# Budgetly

Budgetly is a modern, design-driven budgeting application built to make personal finance feel clear, fast, and intentional — not overwhelming.

The goal wasn’t just to build a budgeting tool. It was to build it the way real products are built: designed first, structured properly, typed safely, connected to a real database, and deployed to production.

## Process

I started by designing the full UI and user flow in Figma — defining layout, hierarchy, spacing, and interaction patterns before writing code.

From there, I translated the design into a scalable frontend using Next.js and TypeScript, keeping components modular and maintainable.

On the backend side, I structured the database using Prisma schema definitions and connected everything to Supabase (PostgreSQL) for authentication and data persistence.

Finally, I deployed the project to Vercel with a production-ready setup.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** — full-stack React framework
- **TypeScript** — type safety and predictable architecture
- **SCSS** — modular styling structure
- **Supabase** — PostgreSQL database & authentication
- **Prisma** — schema modeling and database access layer
- **Figma** — UI/UX design and prototyping
- **Vercel** — deployment, hosting & analytics

## What This Project Shows

- Turning design into production-grade code
- Structuring a real database with Prisma schema
- Integrating Supabase authentication and data flow
- Maintaining clean architecture across frontend and backend
- Deploying a live, full-stack application
